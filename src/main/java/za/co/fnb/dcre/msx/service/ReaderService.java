/**
 * Business tier: parses one pain.012 SBSR acceptance leg, correlates it fail-closed
 * to the MRW outbound registry, and writes it to the ONE response table this
 * service owns.
 *
 * <p>SCRUM-91: the leg is a compile-time property of the service, NOT a
 * {@code reply.type} launch arg. MSX is the SBSR leg reader, the exact mirror of
 * collections CSX; MIX and MPX are its ISR and PBSR twins. That triplication IS
 * the fleet pattern (cix/csx/cpx); the merged three-table reader was MAR's shape
 * and is the deviation this refactor removes.
 *
 * <p>[SYNTHETIC-CONTRACT R-35/A-60] A pain.012 message carries exactly ONE
 * mandate, so the commit unit is the single reply row (not the collections ISR
 * per-Tx fan-out). The write still runs in its OWN REQUIRES_NEW transaction under
 * CrdbRetry, giving the same resume-zero-dup guarantee as the fleet slice-commit
 * pattern: a 40001 abort retries in a fresh tx, and a re-run no-ops over the
 * committed identity via ON CONFLICT (response_file, mndt_req_id) DO NOTHING.
 *
 * <p>CORRELATION is fail-closed (SCRUM-60 canon): the reply's OrgnlMsgId must
 * resolve to a known man_outbound.out_msg_id or the reply is WARNed and EXCLUDED
 * (never ingested, never a guessed family fallback). A known outbound identity is
 * the only evidence the route is real.
