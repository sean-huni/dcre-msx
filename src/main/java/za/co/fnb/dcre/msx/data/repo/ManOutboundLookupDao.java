/**
 * Read-only correlation lookup against {@code man_outbound}, the MRW-owned
 * outbound registry (single writer R-04). MSX NEVER ships the man_outbound
 * changeset in its own changelog (same discipline as IXR vs the crw_* tables);
 * at runtime it lives in the same dcre_man database MRW populates, so MSX reads
 * it directly. {@code out_msg_id} is UNIQUE, so a resolve returns at most one id.
 *
 * <p>Fail-closed correlation (SCRUM-60 canon): the caller excludes a reply whose
 * OrgnlMsgId does not resolve here (WARN + drop, no family fallback, never a
 * guessed route). The row's id is returned only to prove resolution; MSX stores
 * nothing from man_outbound (every persisted column comes from the reply itself).
